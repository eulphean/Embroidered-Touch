# Embroidered Touch
In 2021, Chicago based fashion artist [Anke Loh](http://ankeloh.net/) commissioned Amay Kataria to architect the software for her research project [RE-FREAM](http://ankeloh.net/2021/10/re-fream-embroidered-touch-life-space/#4). As part of [Embroidered Touch](https://amaykataria.com/#/touch), a custom arduino architecture was developed to enable a bi-directional bluetooth communication protocol between multiple types of sweaters bonded with touch sensors and a single web-application. The user can calibrate the sensors from the web-app and their interaction with the sweaters produces a soundscape. A custom backend architecture was developed using web sockets and node.js to allow multiple garments to send sound signals to each other over the internet and engage in a bi-directional communication between each other. 

This project was develped using open-source libraries like [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) and [P5.js](https://p5js.org/).
