# Embroidered Touch
This repository contains all the software engineering commission work for fashion artist [Anke Loh](http://ankeloh.net/) for her research project [RE-FREAM](http://ankeloh.net/2021/10/re-fream-embroidered-touch-life-space/#4). Custom arduino architecture is developed to enable a bi-directional bluetooth communication protocol between a piece of clothing embroidered with touch sensors and a web-application. The user can calibrate the sensors from the web-app and their interaction with the clothing produces a soundscape. A custom backend architecture is developed using web sockets and node.js to allow multiple garments to send sound signals to each other over the internet and engage in a bi-directional communication between each other.
