# Fabric_Instrument
This repository contains the Arduino and P5 code for the grid instrument developed for Anke Loh.

**P5 Code**

The development environment for P5 is setup with gulp and browser-sync for fast and seamless development. After cloning the repo, switch to code_p5 directory using git bash (windows) or terminal (mac) and type the following commands. 
* **npm install** - (If you don't have npm, install npm from [here](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm))
* **gulp** - (This will start a webserver on localhost:8080, which will serve the index.html)

Now, any changes you make to the javascript will be hot realoaded in the browser.
